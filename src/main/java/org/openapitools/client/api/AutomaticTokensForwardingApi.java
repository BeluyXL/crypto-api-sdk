It can be \&quot;SLOW\&quot;, \&quot;STANDARD\&quot; or \&quot;FAST\&quot;.    The response of this endpoint contains an attribute &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; which can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to &#x60;toAddress&#x60; based on what the customer has set for the automation.
