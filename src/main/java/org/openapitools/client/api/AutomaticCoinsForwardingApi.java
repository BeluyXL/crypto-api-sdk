    /**
     * List Coins Forwarding Automations (asynchronously)
     * Through this endpoint customers can list all of their **coins** forwarding automations (**not** tokens).    Customers can set up automatic forwarding functions for coins by setting a &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; and a &#x60;toAddress&#x60;, and specifying the amount that can be transferred between addresses.     A &#x60;feePriority&#x60; will be returned which represents the fee priority of the automation whether it is \&quot;SLOW\&quot;, \&quot;STANDARD\&quot; OR \&quot;FAST\&quot;.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}    {note}Please note that listing data from the same type will apply pagination on the results.{/note}
     * @param blockchain Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. (required)
     * @param network Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \&quot;mainnet\&quot; is the live network with actual data while networks like \&quot;testnet\&quot;, \&quot;ropsten\&quot;, \&quot;rinkeby\&quot; are test networks. (required)
     * @param context In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user. (optional)
     * @param limit Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. (optional, default to 50)
     * @param offset The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. (optional, default to 0)
     * @param _callback The callback to be executed when the API call finishes
     * @return The request call
     * @throws ApiException If fail to process the API call, e.g. serializing the request body object
     * @http.response.details
