Delete Blockchain Event Subscription

Through this endpoint the customer can delete blockchain event subscriptions they have by attributes &#x60;referenceId&#x60; and &#x60;network&#x60;.    Currently Crypto APIs 2.0 offers certain Blockchain event endpoints which allow the user to subscribe for one/a few/all and receive callback notifications when the specific event occurs.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn&#39;t happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiClient;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiException;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.Configuration;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.auth.*;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.ManageSubscriptionsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    ManageSubscriptionsApi apiInstance = new ManageSubscriptionsApi(defaultClient);
    String blockchain = "bitcoin"; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    String network = "testnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
    String referenceId = "d3fd6a0e-f2b6-4bb5-9fd3-7944bcec9e9f"; // String | Represents a unique ID used to reference the specific callback subscription.
    String context = "context_example"; // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
    try {
      DeleteBlockchainEventSubscriptionR result = apiInstance.deleteBlockchainEventSubscription(blockchain, network, referenceId, context);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling ManageSubscriptionsApi#deleteBlockchainEventSubscription");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

List Blockchain Events Subscriptions

Through this endpoint the customer can obtain a list of their callback subscriptions for the available Blockchain events.    Currently Crypto APIs 2.0 offers certain Blockchain event endpoints which allow the user to subscribe for one/a few/all and receive callback notifications when the specific event occurs.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL.

A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}    {note}Please note that listing data from the same type will apply pagination on the results.{/note}
