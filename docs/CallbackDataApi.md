Get Address Details From Callback

This endpoint creates a shortcut to obtain information from Blockchain data by going through Blockchain Events and a specific Event Subscription. It provides data for a specific address from the Event it takes part in only if the address already exists in the blockchain events subscriptions. It applies only for Events related to that customer.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiClient;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiException;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.Configuration;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.auth.*;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.CallbackDataApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    CallbackDataApi apiInstance = new CallbackDataApi(defaultClient);
    String blockchain = "bitcoin"; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    String network = "mainnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
    String address = "mzYijhgmzZrmuB7wBDazRKirnChKyow4M3"; // String | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key.
    String context = "context_example"; // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
    try {
      GetAddressDetailsFromCallbackR result = apiInstance.getAddressDetailsFromCallback(blockchain, network, address, context);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling CallbackDataApi#getAddressDetailsFromCallback");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
