Create Automatic Coins Forwarding

Through this endpoint customers can set up an automatic forwarding function specifically for coins (**not** tokens). They can have a &#x60;toAddress&#x60; which is essentially the main address and the destination for the automatic coins forwarding.     There is also a &#x60;minimumTransferAmount&#x60; which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.    Moreover, &#x60;feePriority&#x60; can be also set,  which defines how quickly to move the coins once they are received. The higher priority, the larger the fee will be. It can be \&quot;SLOW\&quot;, \&quot;STANDARD\&quot; or \&quot;FAST\&quot;.    The response of this endpoint contains an attribute &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; which can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to &#x60;toAddress&#x60; based on what the customer has set for the automation.    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}    {note}This endpoint generates a new &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; each time.{/note}

List Coins Forwarding Automations

Through this endpoint customers can list all of their **coins** forwarding automations (**not** tokens).
