Get Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here. Applies only for coins.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:

Get Transaction Details By Transaction ID

Through this endpoint customers can obtain details about a transaction by the transaction&#39;s unique identifier. In UTXO-based protocols like BTC there are attributes such as &#x60;transactionId&#x60; and transaction &#x60;hash&#x60;. They still could be different. In protocols like Ethereum there is only one unique value and it&#39;s &#x60;hash&#x60;.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **blockchain** | **String**| Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [enum: bitcoin, ethereum, dash, dogecoin, litecoin, bitcoin-cash, ethereum-classic, binance-smart-chain, zcash]
 **network** | **String**| Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \&quot;mainnet\&quot; is the live network with actual data while networks like \&quot;testnet\&quot;, \&quot;ropsten\&quot; are test networks. | [enum: mainnet, testnet, ropsten, mordor]
 **height** | **Integer**| Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \&quot;Genesis block\&quot;. |
 **context** | **String**| In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user. | [optional]
 **limit** | **Integer**| Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. | [optional] [default to 50]
 **offset** | **Integer**| The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. | [optional] [default to 0]

List Unconfirmed Transactions by Address

Through this endpoint customers can list transactions by &#x60;address&#x60; that are **unconfirmed**.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiClient;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiException;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.Configuration;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.auth.*;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.UnifiedEndpointsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    UnifiedEndpointsApi apiInstance = new UnifiedEndpointsApi(defaultClient);
    String blockchain = "bitcoin"; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    String network = "mainnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
    String address = "2NDt6eztswLiVgVYaGUhkTPmugUGovVypAe"; // String | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key.
    String context = "context_example"; // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
    Integer limit = 50; // Integer | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
    Integer offset = 0; // Integer | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.
    try {
      ListUnconfirmedTransactionsByAddressR result = apiInstance.listUnconfirmedTransactionsByAddress(blockchain, network, address, context, limit, offset);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling UnifiedEndpointsApi#listUnconfirmedTransactionsByAddress");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
