Get Token Details by Contract Address

Though this endpoint customers can obtain information about token details. This can be done by providing the &#x60;contact address&#x60; parameter.    {note}This address is **not** the same as the smart contract creator address.{/note}

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiClient;

    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    TokensApi apiInstance = new TokensApi(defaultClient);
    String blockchain = "ethereum"; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    String network = "mainnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
