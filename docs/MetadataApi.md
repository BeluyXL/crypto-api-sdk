List Supported Assets

This endpoint will return a list of supported assets. The asset could be a cryptocurrency or FIAT assets that we support. Each asset has a unique identifier - &#x60;assetId&#x60; and a unique symbol in the form of a string, e.g. \&quot;BTC\&quot;.    {note}Please note that listing data from the same type will apply pagination on the results.{/note}

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiClient;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiException;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.Configuration;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.auth.*;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.MetadataApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    MetadataApi apiInstance = new MetadataApi(defaultClient);
    String context = "context_example"; // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
    String assetType = "crypto"; // String | Defines the type of the supported asset. This could be either \"crypto\" or \"fiat\".
    Integer limit = 50; // Integer | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
    Integer offset = 0; // Integer | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.
    try {
      ListSupportedAssetsR result = apiInstance.listSupportedAssets(context, assetType, limit, offset);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling MetadataApi#listSupportedAssets");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
