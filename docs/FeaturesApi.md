Broadcast Locally Signed Transaction

Through this endpoint customers can broadcast transactions that have been already signed locally. Instead of using a node for broadcasting a signed transaction users can use this endpoint. We then keep the user posted about the status by sending you a callback with a success or failure status.    {warning}This can be prepared and signed **only** locally, not through the API. We can provide support only for the process of broadcasting.{/warning}

> DeriveHDWalletXPubYPubZPubChangeOrReceivingAddressesR deriveHDWalletXPubYPubZPubChangeOrReceivingAddresses(blockchain, extendedPublicKey, network, context, addressFormat, addressesCount, isChange, startIndex)

Derive HD Wallet (xPub, yPub, zPub) Change Or Receiving Addresses

Through this endpoint, customers can derive up to 10 addresses - both change and receive, from a certain HD Wallet (xPub, yPub, zPub), by providing an extended public key. By default the system creates a receiving/deposit address, unless the isChange attribute is set to &#39;true&#39;. In that case the system derives a &#39;change&#39; address. The change address can be derived only for UTXO based blockchains, for all the rest, this endpoint always creates a deposit/receiving address.

    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    FeaturesApi apiInstance = new FeaturesApi(defaultClient);
    Integer addressTag = 3999472835; // Integer | Defines a specific Tag that is an additional XRP address feature. It helps identifying a transaction recipient beyond a wallet address.
