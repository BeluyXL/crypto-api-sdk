Get Omni Transaction Details By Transaction ID (Txid)

Through this endpoint customers can obtain details about an Omni transaction by the transaction&#39;s unique identifier. The transaction can return information such as hash, height, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    OmniLayerApi apiInstance = new OmniLayerApi(defaultClient);
    String network = "mainnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.

List Omni Transactions By Block Height

This endpoint will list Omni transactions by an attribute &#x60;blockHeight&#x60;. The transactions listed will detail additional information such as hash, addresses, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiClient;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.ApiException;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.Configuration;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.auth.*;
import io.cryptoapis.sdk.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.OmniLayerApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");
    ApiKey.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    OmniLayerApi apiInstance = new OmniLayerApi(defaultClient);
    String network = "mainnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
    String blockchain = "bitcoin"; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    String blockHeight = "1941222"; // String | Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \"Genesis block\".
    String context = "yourExampleString"; // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
    Integer limit = 50; // Integer | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
    Integer offset = 0; // Integer | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.
    try {
      ListOmniTransactionsByBlockHeightR result = apiInstance.listOmniTransactionsByBlockHeight(network, blockchain, blockHeight, context, limit, offset);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling OmniLayerApi#listOmniTransactionsByBlockHeight");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
