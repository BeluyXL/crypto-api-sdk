Block Height Reached

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific block height that hasn&#39;t been reached yet. In this case the event is when the specified block height in the request body is reached in a said blockchain. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs.

# **minedTransaction**
> MinedTransactionR minedTransaction(blockchain, network, context, minedTransactionRB)

Mined transaction

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a specific transaction is mined. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified &#x60;transactionId&#x60;.    A transaction is mined when it is included in a new block in the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn&#39;t happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

# **newBlock**
> NewBlockR newBlock(blockchain, network, context, newBlockRB)

New Block

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a new block is mined in the specific blockchain. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.    A new block is mined when it is added to the chain once a consensus is reached by the majority of the miners, which is when the block gets validated and added to the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn&#39;t happen at all, or takes a long time to do so.

> NewConfirmedCoinsTransactionsForSpecificAmountR newConfirmedCoinsTransactionsForSpecificAmount(blockchain, network, context, newConfirmedCoinsTransactionsForSpecificAmountRB)

New Confirmed Coins Transactions For Specific Amount

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event and \&quot;amountHigherThan\&quot; value. In this case the event is when there are new incoming or outgoing confirmed coins transactions for the specified blockchain and the amount is equal or higher than the value specified.  By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs  filtered for the specified amount. The information is returned per specified address.    Being confirmed means that the transactions are verified by miners and added to the next block.

New confirmed tokens transactions

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new incoming or outgoing confirmed transactions for tokens from/to the customer&#39;s address. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.     Being confirmed means that the transactions are verified by miners and added to the next block. This endpoint refers to **tokens transactions only, not coins**.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn&#39;t happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

New confirmed tokens transactions and each confirmation

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new incoming or outgoing confirmed transactions for tokens from/to the customer&#39;s address with also a response at each confirmation the transaction has received until the specified confirmations limit is reached. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.     Being confirmed means that the transactions are verified by miners and added to the next block. This endpoint refers to **tokens transactions only, not coins**.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs.

New unconfirmed coins transactions

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new unconfirmed coins transactions for the user. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.    Unconfirmed coins transactions remain in the mempool (memory pool) until they are confirmed by miners and added to the next block. Sometimes spikes in transaction activity can cause delays in confirmations.    {note}For UTXO-based protocols like Bitcoin a transaction could have multiple inputs and outputs which means the address could in as both sender and recipient. [Here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-data-returned-for-utxo-based-transactions) is how we inform you on that.{/note}    {warning}We cannot guarantee at 100% that webhooks for unconfirmed transactions will always be received. Some may **not get received** due to the possibility of some nodes not being updated with that information. This can occur in networks with low activity and/or not many nodes, e.g. Testnet networks and rarely Mainnets.{/warning}    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {note}It is also **important to note** that just because pending unconfirmed transactions are in the mempool, **doesn&#39;t necessarily** mean they will get confirmed.{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs.
