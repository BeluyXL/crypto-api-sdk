Get Latest Mined XRP (Ripple) Block

Through this endpoint customers can fetch the last mined XRP block in the blockchain, along with its details. These could include the hash of the specific, the previous and the next block, its transactions count, its height, etc.     Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn&#39;t unified.

List XRP (Ripple) Transactions By Block Hash

This endpoint will list transactions by an attribute &#x60;blockHash&#x60;. The transactions listed will detail additional information such as hash, addresses, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.    Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn&#39;t unified.
